Hi, I’m @shsgResume. I’m interested in modelling, it can be either Data Science only or other general applications of modelling. In particular, I have an interet to model Mathematical findings, Physics experiments and theories, as well as the general behaviour of data. I’m currently learning some game theory stuff because I enjoy the complexity of a seemingly simple situation
